# Biaxial Recurrent Neural Network for Music Composition

This code implements a recurrent neural network trained to generate classical music. The model, which uses LSTM layers and draws inspiration from convolutional neural networks, learns to predict which notes will be played at each time step of a musical piece.

You can read about its design and hear examples on [this blog post](http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/). 

## Requirements
1 ,Try to run biaxia_1st_structur.sh e to automatically download and install required software

2, Run biaxia_2nd_reboot.sh or manually reboot after installing

3, Have a test using biaxia_3rd_test.sh which can tell you if you install all the things correctly
